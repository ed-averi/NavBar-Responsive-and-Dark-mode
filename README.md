In this project I used the following:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
- [Boxicons](https://boxicons.com)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com)

The main objective is to be able to create a website from scratch without worring too much about the footer and navigation bar and a dark mode button that works, the navbar is also responsive.
